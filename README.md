# React Projects

## Project 1 -- My Todo App 
A clean and simple to-do list built with React and Tailwind CSS. This project helps users manage daily tasks with features like adding, editing, completing, deleting, and filtering tasks.

### 🔧 Features

- ✅ Add tasks
- ✏️ Edit and update existing tasks
- ✔️ Mark tasks as completed
- ❌ Delete tasks
- 🔍 Filter tasks by:
  - All
  - Pending
  - Completed

### Modular structure with components:

 - Header.jsx: Displays the title
 - Tabs.jsx: Filters tasks
 - TodoInput.jsx: Input for new tasks
 - TodoList.jsx: Shows task list and actions

Ideal as a beginner-to-intermediate React project focusing on component reusability, props handling, state management, and conditional rendering.
